# path to the metadata file telling us which slides to process
image_metadata:

# the directory where the input slide images are located. Absolute path!
input_dir:

# an integer describing which tile extractor should be used. See the 
# src/utils/image_utils.py file to select
tile_extraction_style:

# which shard is being processed, if shards are being used to parallelize
# jobs over multiple worker nodes. Optional!
shard:

# how many tiles should we extract from the slide image
num_tiles: 512

# tiles are assumed square- this is the pixel dimension
tile_size: 192

# the zoom level for the slide images. Lower numbers are more zoomed-in
# but naturally might have less larger-scale structural context
level: 1

# During tile extraction, we essentially place a grid over the slide 
# image and grab tiles from there. The offset mode dictates where this grid's
# origin is located. 0 means the top left of the tile grid is aligned 
# with the top left of the image. Mode 2 means the starting position is offset
# by half of the tile size in both directions, so we pick up a translated
# grid instead
offset_mode: 0 

# some tiles can appear blurry and we use a threshold on the variance
# of the discrete laplacian to remove those. Only used by specific
# tile extraction classes
